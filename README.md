# ar_maze
**Package ar_maze aimed to provide robot navigation through the maze with ar tags. In the beginning robot is given by a list of ar tags. Reaching them one by one, robot successfully completes the maze.**

**Package consists of**:
- `main_project` node
- `nav_if_walls` node
- `ar_maze.launch` launch file</br>
However, for package functioning there are two deafult packages required: `ar_track_alvar` and `robotont_laserscan_to_distance`.
